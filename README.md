# **Milestone Project 1**
## __Introduction__

<p style="text-align:justify;">The guide lines for the development of this first project are crucial to ensure a solid structure and effective progress. Here are the key principles on which this project is based. The recommended materials during the HTML and CSS course have been used.</p>


The project will be developed in 5 phases called:
* Strategy plane
* Scope plane
* Structure plane
* Skeleton plane
* Surface plane

 |  **Plane**   |                   **Objective of this phase**                   |
 | --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------  |
 | Strategy  | What is the primary goal, and what is the project target audience. | 
 | Scope     | Which design features do you want include in the design.           |
 | Structure | The information is arranged in a structured manner.                |
 | Skeleton  | How the information should be implemented.                         |
 | Surface   | What is the choises made for the design elements, color etc.                                       |

## Strategy
#### In this first part of the strategy, it is importante to ask questions:

<p style="text-align:justify;">As can see from the diagram it is crucial to know and inquire about the  what actions is one considering  taking, the added value that can be provided, wheter  what is being planned is culturally appropriate, and whether one is targeting the desired audience, and so on.</p>

### Strategy - Research
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the first step, it is crucial to conduct research. To start a focused research, it is important to follow the step below:</p>

1. *Stakeholder Interview.*
   1. The number one point is crucial, and it is of fundamental importance to engage with stakeholders, thoroughly   
      understand their needs and requests, and ask questions.
2. *Competitor review.*
   1. Another important point is to analyse the work that competitors are doing and investigate how they are doing it.
3. *User Interviews.*
   1. Through questions or surveys, ask users what they think, what their opinions are, and what their needs are.
4. *Existing Produc Audit.*
   1. If we are working with an existing product, investigate what works and what does not, ask customers what they would 
      change, inquire whit users.
5. *Analise and Review.*
   1. When we have all this data available, we need to perform an analisis and a review.

# **Milestone Project 1 Guidelines**
## __Introduction__

<p style="text-align:justify;">The guide lines for the development of this first project are crucial to ensure a solid structure and effective progress. Here are the key principles on which this project is based. The recommended materials during the HTML and CSS course have been used.</p>


The project will be developed in 5 phases called:
* Strategy plane
* Scope plane
* Structure plane
* Skeleton plane
* Surface plane

 |  **Plane**   |                   **Objective of this phase**                   |
 | --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------  |
 | Strategy  | What is the primary goal, and what is the project target audience. | 
 | Scope     | Which design features do you want include in the design.           |
 | Structure | The information is arranged in a structured manner.                |
 | Skeleton  | How the information should be implemented.                         |
 | Surface   | What is the choises made for the design elements, color etc.                                       |

## Strategy
#### In this first part of the strategy, it is importante to ask questions:
![StrategyQuest](https://github.com/ChristianCricchi/MilestoneProject1/assets/122015372/be09a827-66c7-4f8b-ae87-f6822ac314c9)

<p style="text-align:justify;">As can see from the diagram it is crucial to know and inquire about the  what actions is one considering  taking, the added value that can be provided, wheter  what is being planned is culturally appropriate, and whether one is targeting the desired audience, and so on.</p>

### Strategy - Research
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the first step, it is crucial to conduct research. To start a focused research, it is important to follow the step below:</p>

1. *Stakeholder Interview.*
   1. The number one point is crucial, and it is of fundamental importance to engage with stakeholders, thoroughly   
      understand their needs and requests, and ask questions.
2. *Competitor review.*
   1. Another important point is to analyse the work that competitors are doing and investigate how they are doing it.
3. *User Interviews.*
   1. Through questions or surveys, ask users what they think, what their opinions are, and what their needs are.
4. *Existing Product Audit.*
   1. If we are working with an existing product, investigate what works and what does not, ask customers what they would 
      change, inquire whit users.
5. *Analise and Review.*
   1. When we have all this data available, we need to perform an analisis and a review.

  ### Strategy - Research (Bussiness)
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this phase, following the conducted research and analisis, it is important acquire a deeper understanding of the bussinnes.</p>

1. *What is your day to day role?*
   1. What are the activities that are carried out daily by your system?
   2. Interview potential users.
2. *What function do you perform?*
   1. What are the function that are performed in your  system?
   2. Interview potential users.
3. *What other function are present?*
   1. What other types of functions are present?
   2. Interview potential users.
4. *How those function interact?*
   1. Discovering the connection between the different functions of your system.
5. *How does it compare to other experiences?*
   1. It isimportant to make comparisons with other systems.
6. *What technology siystems do you use?*
   1. It is important to know what is the technology that is in use.

 ### Strategy - Research (Consumers)
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another perspective to take in consideration is the perspective of consumers.</p>

1. *What makes a great [  ] experience?*
   1. Asking consumers aboout the elements that contribute having an excellent experience.
   2. Asking how do consumers visit or use the application.
2. *What the consumers uses the most and what their primary activity is.*
   1. Ask where would they go first and why?
   2.  What do you most use it for?
3. *What they want and why.*
   1. Asking what they would and why?
   2. Asking what the consumer do before and after using the product.
4. *Who is the target audience.*
   1. What the demographic/demographics and social audience.
5. *How is offering difference from competitors?*
   1. How we differentiate ourselves from our competitors?
  
### Strategy - How decide what keep and what do not keep.
1. It is important to make a list of oppportunities and prioritise them based on:
   1. *Importance*
      1. How crucial is that? the problem for the bussiness is solved?
   2. *Viability*
      1. How realistic it is, it is possible to implement a solution?


 ## Scope
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the strategic phase, it is crucial to define what options are being considered and what is excluded from consideration. Further refinement occurs at Scope level where it is important to decide which features aligned with business objectives and user need are in or out of the Scope.</p> 

### Scope - Trade Offs

1. It is important defined a *scope*.
   1. Strive to obtain a comprehensive overview of the features and content currently.
2. *Document*.
   1. What is included and what is not included at this moment.
3. *Agile* approach.
   1. It is a flexible and iterative  methodology that emphasises collaboration, adaptability to change, and delivering 
      incremental improvements is short cycle.
   2. At this point it is important commiting small, managable stages of progress.
   3. It is also important to keep the documentation to a minimun.
4. *Simplify* the features.
   1. Maintain a manageble schedule, and establish your critical milestones.
5. *Now* new idea can be posponed for a future release.
6. *Identify* what need to be done now and what can wait.
7. *Create* your Sprint.
   1. Sprint is a diratiom in time in which you commit to building something.

### Scope - Requirements

The scope revolves around requirements and functional specifications.
1. What users and stakeholders say they need.
2. What they actually need.
3. What they do not to need.

<p style="text-align:justify;">In software development, a requirement is a documented description of a function, capability or characteristic that a software system must possess. Requirements serve as foundation for designing, implementing, and testing software providing a clear undestanding of what the software should accomplish and how should behave.</p> 

1. *Funtional requirements.*
   1. Specify the system behaviour.
2. *Non functional requirements*
   1. Define  qualities like performance, usbillity, and security.
3. *Scalability*
   1. Refers to the ability of a system or application  to handle a growing amount of work, data or users.
4. *User story*
   1. Is a concise, informal description of a feature. functionality , or task from and-users perspective.
   2. Normally follows a simple template that includes a persona, a specific action and an intended outcome.
   3. The purpose is to capture the requirements and expectation of users.
      1. A standard template could be:
         1. **Type of user:** Describe the user or role involved.
         2. **Action:** Specifies what the user wants to accomplish.
         3. **Benefit/value:** Explain the reason or benefit  the user gains from completing tha action. 

The goal is to ensure that the software meets the needs and specifications of its users.

## Structure

<p style="text-align:justify;">The structural aspect focuses on arranging functions and content, ensuring an intuitive flow through the features and information. Structure also encompases the categorization of information and deals with how it is presented and organised. The goal of this step is to guarantee an intuitive organisation and presentation of information. Select the framework with consideration of the audience and cultural context. It is important  undersatand the demographic of the users, know the users and make sure that the structure aligns with the targeted audience</p> 

### Structure - Interaction Design

Interaction design is also a focus within the structural aspect.

1. Interaction design entails defining both the structure and behavior of interactive systems.
2. It establishes significant connections among the elements, the contents, and the information.
3. Communicates funtionality and interactivity.
4. Reveals workflows.
5. It reduces the risk of user error.

The elements of interaction design can be categorised into five concerns:
1. *Consistent.*
2. *Predictable.*
3. *Learnable.*
4. *Visible.*
5. *Provide clear and intuitive feedback.*

### Structure - Architecture

Another key focus of the  structural aspects is information architecture, it takes on the responsability of crafting organisational and navigational structures. Effective information also permits owners to adapt to growth and changes.

#### Architecture Types:

 1. *Tree structure*
    1. It follows a conventional layout, simplifying complexity by progressively revealing information and structures while navigating up and down the three. It poses some challenge on mobile divices. If a user has to go through more than three clicks to reach their destination, it is like to result in congnitive overload.
       1. *Cognitive overload* in the context of design happens when users are overwhelmed by too much information, complex navigation etc.
2. *Nested list*
   1. It is designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices, offering a strightforward jorney to detail information. While it simplifies complexity by providing a clearly defined path to the destination, it may limit exploration due to its linear nature.
3. *Hub and Spoke*
   1. This structures has a central home point that has links to various spokes, each holding specific sections of informations. This structure is effective for apps with multiple features. It does not allows direct navigation between the spokes, it is necessary to return to the central home before moving to another spoke.
4. *Dashboard*
   1. It proves highly  beneficial for quickly accessing key information at a glance. The primary dashboard elements can be expanded to diaplay detailed views of the information. The dashboar provides a summary, and cliking on its elements unveils more detailed information. This design is better suited for desktop usage.

# **Milestone Project 1 Guidelines**
## __Introduction__

<p style="text-align:justify;">The guide lines for the development of this first project are crucial to ensure a solid structure and effective progress. Here are the key principles on which this project is based. The recommended materials during the HTML and CSS course have been used.</p>


The project will be developed in 5 phases called:
* Strategy plane
* Scope plane
* Structure plane
* Skeleton plane
* Surface plane

 |  **Plane**   |                   **Objective of this phase**                   |
 | --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------  |
 | Strategy  | What is the primary goal, and what is the project target audience. | 
 | Scope     | Which design features do you want include in the design.           |
 | Structure | The information is arranged in a structured manner.                |
 | Skeleton  | How the information should be implemented.                         |
 | Surface   | What is the choises made for the design elements, color etc.                                       |

## Strategy
#### In this first part of the strategy, it is importante to ask questions:

<p style="text-align:justify;">As can see from the diagram it is crucial to know and inquire about the  what actions is one considering  taking, the added value that can be provided, wheter  what is being planned is culturally appropriate, and whether one is targeting the desired audience, and so on.</p>

### Strategy - Research
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the first step, it is crucial to conduct research. To start a focused research, it is important to follow the step below:</p>

1. *Stakeholder Interview.*
   1. The number one point is crucial, and it is of fundamental importance to engage with stakeholders, thoroughly   
      understand their needs and requests, and ask questions.
2. *Competitor review.*
   1. Another important point is to analyse the work that competitors are doing and investigate how they are doing it.
3. *User Interviews.*
   1. Through questions or surveys, ask users what they think, what their opinions are, and what their needs are.
4. *Existing Produc Audit.*
   1. If we are working with an existing product, investigate what works and what does not, ask customers what they would 
      change, inquire whit users.
5. *Analise and Review.*
   1. When we have all this data available, we need to perform an analisis and a review.

  ### Strategy - Research (Bussiness)
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this phase, following the conducted research and analisis, it is important acquire a deeper understanding of the bussinnes.</p>

1. *What is your day to day role?*
   1. What are the activities that are carried out daily by your system?
   2. Interview potential users.
2. *What function do you perferm?*
   1. What are the function that are performed in your  system?
   2. Interview potential users.
3. *What other function are present?*
   1. What other types of functions are present?
   2. Interview potential users.
4. *How those function interact?*
   1. Discovering the connection between the different functions of your system.
5. *How does it compare to other experiences?*
   1. It isimportant to make comparisons with other systems.
6. *What technology siystems do you use?*
   1. It is important to know what is the technology that is in use.

 ### Strategy - Research (Consumers)
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another perspective to take in consideration is the perspective of consumers.</p>

1. *What makes a great [  ] experience?*
   1. Asking consumers aboout the elements that contribute having an excellent experience.

   2.  What do you most use it for?
3. *What they want and why.*
   1. Asking what they would and why?
   2. Asking what the consumer do before and after using the product.
4. *Who is the target audience.*
   1. What the demographic/demographics and social audience.
5. *How is offering difference from competitors?*
   1. How we differentiate ourselves from our competitors?
  
### Strategy - How decide decide what keep and what do not keep.
1. It is important to make a list of oppportunities and prioritise them based on:
   1. *Importance*
      1. How crucial is that? the problem for the bussiness is solved?
   2. *Viability*
      1. How realistic it is, it is possible to implement a solution?


 ## Scope
 <p style="text-align:justify;">In the strategic phase, it is crucial to define what options are being considered and what is excluded from consideration. Further refinement occurs at Scope level where it is important to decide which features aligned with business objectives and user need are in or out of the Scope.</p> 

 ### Scope - Trade Offs

1. It is important defined a *scope*.
   1. Strive to obtain a comprehensive overview of the features and content currently.
2. *Document*.
   1. What is included and what is not included at this moment.
3. *Agile* approach.
   1. It is a flexible and iterative  methodology that emphasises collaboration, adaptability to change, and delivering 
      incremental improvements is short cycle.
   2. At this point it is important commiting small, managable stages of progress.
   3. It is also important to keep the documentation to a minimun.
4. *Simplify* the features.
   1. Maintain a manageble schedule, and establish your critical milestones.
5. *Now* new idea can be posponed for a future release.
6. *Identify* what need to be done now and what can wait.
7. *Create* your Sprint.
   1. Sprint is a diratiom in time in which you commit to building something.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The guide lines for the development of this first project are crucial to ensure a solid structure and effective progress. Here are the key principles on which this project is based. The recommended materials during the HTML and CSS course have been used.</p>


The project will be developed in 5 phases called:
* Strategy plane
* Scope plane
* Structure plane
* Skeleton plane
* Surface plane

 |  **Plane**   |                   **Objective of this phase**                   |
